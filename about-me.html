        <p class="important-description">
          Hi, I'm VerÃ³nica! I love technologies and living in the Canary Islands. A few years ago I was studying make
          up, but I decided to change course and enter the technological world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 I did a full stack bootcamp in Gran Canaria, where I have acquired programming knowledge, I have
          learned to handle tools and how to work as a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 have spent three months in a company as an intern, which has helped me improve my teamwork and see how
          a company works from the inside
        </p>
        <p>
          I also consider myself a person who likes to learn, hard-working and very enthusiastic.
